# Interestnpy

## Dynamic analysis of communal real estate price determinants and the impact of interest rates on the housing market
This project, a part of the Python course in the second year of the engineering program at ENSAE, aims to study the impact of interest rates on real estate prices at the local level, considering local town characteristics. By employing advanced econometric techniques and data analysis in Python, we seek to understand how fluctuations in interest rates influence the real estate market across various municipalities.

## Objective
The primary goal is to analyze the dynamic determinants of municipal real estate prices and study the impact of interest rates on the housing market using econometric methods. This involves exploring both time-series and panel data to provide a comprehensive understanding.

## Data and Methodology

-   **Data Sources**: [List of sources]
-  **Aggregation** : [Explained aggregation] 
-   **Econometric Approach**: Our econometric approach, employs both time-series and panel data methods to dissect and understand trends and patterns.

## Tools and Technologies

-   **Python**: The entire project is developed using Python, leveraging its powerful libraries for data analysis, data viz, and econometrics.
-   **Libraries**: Key Python libraries used include pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and statsmodels for econometric modeling.
